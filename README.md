You can also lik the project with already existing conda environments or github repos.

CARE:
The ```-gh, --git-hook``` command is in beta. This command exports before each git commit the conda environment.

```
usage: cobra create [-h] -n PROJECT_NAME [-p PYTHON_VERSION] [-r REPO_NAME]
                   [-c CONDA_NAME] [-gh]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n PROJECT_NAME, --project-name PROJECT_NAME
                        Name of the project
  -p PYTHON_VERSION, --python-version PYTHON_VERSION
                        Python version for the project. Default: 3.5
  -r REPO_NAME, --repo-name REPO_NAME
                        If you already have a github repo for the project.
                        Enter the repo name.
  -c CONDA_NAME, --conda-name CONDA_NAME
                        If you already have a conda environment for the
                        project. Enter the name.
  -gh, --git-hook       Install a pre-commit git hook which updates the conda
                        environment file before you commit. This is just
                        working, if the current environment is the
